Extends any arithmetic tuple by predicting its next n terms with flair.
📘 README: Tuple Extension in Arithmetic Progression
Extends any arithmetic sequence stored as a tuple — by calculating and appending its next n terms.

🧩 Overview
Given a tuple that follows an arithmetic progression (A.P.), this Python solution predicts the next n numbers in the sequence and appends them to the original tuple. Whether the difference is positive, negative, or zero — it handles the extension dynamically.

🔍 Problem Statement
You’re given a tuple of integers that form a valid A.P. Your task is to compute the next n terms based on the common difference and return the extended sequence as a tuple.

Example Input:

python
tup = (2, 4, 6, 8)
n = 5
Output:

python
(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18)
⚙️ How It Works
Identify the common difference between consecutive elements.

Compute and append the next n terms using the last value and the difference.

Return the full, extended sequence as a tuple.


✅ Edge Cases
Works for both increasing and decreasing A.P.

Handles zero common difference sequences 

💡 Applications

Practicing Python tuples and loop manipulation

Generating predictable sequences in math or simulations

Customizing coding challenges with variable-length sequence
